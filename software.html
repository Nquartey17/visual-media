<h2>Editing software</h2>
<p>There are plently of video editing programs to choose from which vary from 
a range of different prices as well. Below are some potential programs to look into
if interested. Difficuly will be rated on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being easiest and
10 being the most difficult.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Windows Movie Maker</li>
</ol>
<img src="images/windowsmm.png" alt="wmm" height=150 width=200>
<ul>
	<li>Price: Free</li>
	<li>Download space: About 2 GB</li>
	<li>Difficuly using: 1. Windows Movie maker is a good start for people who would 
	want to know the basics of video editing. It's a free download depending on which 
	version you are installing, the 2016 version is free.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>Vegas Pro 17</li>
</ol>
<img src="images/vegaspro.png" alt="vegas" height=150 width=200>

<ul>
	<li>Price: $299.00 USD</li>
	<li>Download space:700 MB to 2 GB depending on version </li>
	<li>Difficuly using: I found Sony Vegas fairly easy to use. There were many 
	tutorials online to teach the software so I would give it a 4. The price
	listed is for the current version of the product, the previous versions are 
	similar to the current version but with less features</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>Adobe Premiere Pro CC</li>
</ol>
<img src="images/premierepro.jpg" alt="premiere" height=150 width=200>
<ul>
	<li>Price: $20.99/$31.49 USD per month, $239.88 USD per year</li>
	<li>Download space: About 2 GB</li>
	<li>Difficuly using: 5. I found Sony Vegas much easier to use than Premiere. 
	I think Premiere is like a middle ground for software editing, though if you 
	are a beginner, I would also recommend this program. Personally, I think you 
	can do more professionally if you know how to use Premiere as it works well 
	with most of the other Adobe Creative Cloud products.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>Lightworks</li>
</ol>
<img src="images/lightwork.jpg" alt="lw" height=150 width=200>
<ul>
	<li>Price: $24.99/$174.99 USB per month, depending on pricing plan</li>
	<li>Download space: About 200 MB </li>
	<li>Difficuly using: 3. Lightworks is fairly easy to use, there are free and 
	full version features in case it is a product you like. Lightworks doesn't have 
	too many features, which I think is good for someone who is a beginner or intermediate 
	video editor.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>Adobe After Effects CC</li>
</ol>
<img src="images/aftereffects.png" alt="ae" height=150 width=200>
<ul>
	<li>Price: $21.00 USD per month, $53.00 USD per month with Adobe Creative Suite</li>
	<li>Download space: 3.08 GB</li>
	<li>Difficuly using: 9. Of all the programs listed, I had the most trouble using 
	after effects. The program is based more experienced editors, though tutorials 
	can be found online. This is a program I would recommend after a few months or of 
	video editing, most of what I was doing was creating effects from scratch or 
	using the Roto-brush tool to cut things from videos.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>Other</li>
</ol>
<p>The programs listed above are the ones that I have some experience using, but there are plenty 
other programs that you can try. They range from beginner to professional and all are used for different 
purposes. Here are some examples:</p>

	<li>iMovie</li>
	<li>VideoPad Video editor</li>
	<li>Media 100</li>
	<li>OpenShotot</li>
	<li>Pinnacle Studio</li>
	<li>Avidemux</li>
	<li>Nero Vision</li>
	<li>WeVideo</li>
